	- LilyGo T-Display S3
	- LilyGo T-Display
	- LilyGo T-Display T4
	- M5Stack Fire
	- M5Stick C
	- Generic ESP32 + [Supported display](https://esphome.io/components/display/index.html#see-also "Supported display")

[ESPHome install guide](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html)
> Note: To use fonts and images in this project, you will need to have the python pillow package installed. If you are running this project as a Home Assistant add-on or with the official ESPHome docker image, the package should already be installed. Otherwise, you can install it using the command `pip install "pillow==10.1.0"`. For more information, refer to the [ESPHome documentation on images](https://esphome.io/components/display/index.html#images).

### 2. Include the homeThing components in your yaml
```yaml
external_components:
  - source: # homeThing, display setup, and now playing app
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/landonr/homeThing
      ref: main
    refresh: 0s
    components: [
      homeThing, 
      homeThingDisplayState,
      homeThingApp, # only required if using apps
      homeThingAppNowPlaying # only required for Now Playing app
    ]
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/landonr/esphome-components
      ref: main
    refresh: 0s
    components: [

```yaml
packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/landonr/homeThing
    ref: main
    files: [
      common/device_base.yaml, # defines api, ota, free memory and uptime sensor
      common/ipod/lilygo_tdisplay_ipod_backlight.yaml, # used for toggling backlight
      common/ipod/lilygo_tdisplay_ipod_battery.yaml, # used for battery percent
      common/ipod/lilygo_tdisplay_ipod_binary_sensor.yaml, # used for button controls
      common/ipod/lilygo_tdisplay_ipod_rotary.yaml, # used for rotary controls
      common/ipod/lilygo_tdisplay_ipod_sleep.yaml, # required for device to sleep
      common/fonts.yaml, # default font
      common/icon_fonts.yaml # material icons
      common/images.yaml, # boot screen image
    ]
    refresh: 0s

### 7. Install on your device

- [ESPHome Command Line](https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome.html)
### 8. Add the device to Home Assistant
- Home Assistant should auto discover the device and send a notification
	- If not, add a ESPHome integration using the ip address of the homeThing device
- Allow API calls from the device by clicking configure on it, then checking the **Allow the device to make Home Assistant service calls** checkbox
### 9. **Done! ðŸŽ‰**
