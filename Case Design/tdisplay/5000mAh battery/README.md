# 3D Case Design
## _Designed to fit a 5000 mAh battery_

Main components can be seen in the "main components.jpg" photo.
![Alt text](<main components.jpg>)
Components list:
- 5000 mAh battery (check the form factor in "main components.jpg" photo; it was bought from a local store so i'm note sure a link would be useful)
- Lilygo T-Display TTGO
- Adafruit ANO Directional Navigation and Scroll Wheel Rotary Encoder [https://www.adafruit.com/product/5001]
- Adafruit ANO Rotary Navigation Encoder Breakout PCB [https://www.adafruit.com/product/5221]

## Details

- Based on the original board mount & buttons from here [https://github.com/landonr/homeThing/tree/main/Case%20Design/tdisplay], hence I added the same buttons file
- The case from the images was printed on an FDM printer in glow-in-the-dark PLA(Ender 3 v2); I assume it can also be printed on a SLA printer

## Print settings

| Setting | value |
| ------ | ------ |
| Rafts | no |
| Supports | no - for the case parts / yes - only for the buttons, which were printed face down with the face that will be touched by the user |
| Resolution | 0.12 mm |
| Infill | 40% |
| Speed | 75 mm/s |
| Outer wall speed | 37.5 mm/s |
| Inner wall speed | 50 mm/s |
| Wall line count | 4 - do not decrease this! otherwise the curvature of the case will look bad |
